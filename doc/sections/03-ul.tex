        \hline
        \textbf{Term} & \textbf{Definition}\\
        \hline
        \ul{Micro City}{Area with bounded temporal and spatial extension. It is populated with guests interested in the activities inside it.}
        \ul{Boundary}{Physical perimeter that defines the boundary of the \textit{Micro City}.}
        \ul{Lifetime of the Micro City}{The time span in which the Micro City is accessible by/open to the guests and the activities operate.}
        \ul{Guest}{A person interested in the activities offered by the \textit{Micro City}}
        \ul{Group of Guests}{A set of guests that are interested in the same activities and move together.}
        \ul{Activity}{Service or event that is carried out inside the \textit{Micro City} and it's able to satisfy a certain amount of guests with a certain frequency. An activity is active during a time period that determines its operation time. Moreover, it may be static, if it can't move or dynamic, if it may move when necessary.}
        \ul{Service}{Type of activity that is continuously available during the \textit{Micro City}'s lifetime and allows guests to benefit from it at any time.}
        \ul{Event}{Type of activity that takes place in a specific moment and is carried out only once; once it terminates, it won't be further available.}
        \ul{Satisfy}{The action of an activity of providing the guests with an experience or a product.}
        \ul{Benefit From/Attend}{The act of a guest of exploiting an activity and being satisfied by it.}
        \ul{Time Period}{An activity's operation time span. It is defined by a start and a finish.}
        \ul{Duration}{The time taken by an activity to satisfy one or more guests.}
        \ul{Waiting Time}{Amount of time that guests wait before benefiting from an activity.}
        \ul{Queue}{Set of aligned guests due to long waiting time.}
        \ul{Fee}{Amount of money that guests may have to pay in order to access the \textit{Micro City} and/or to benefit from activities.}
        \ul{Wearable}{Device owned by each guest (or group of guests) that allows them to interact with the \textit{Micro City}.}
        \ul{Worker}{Internal operator of a \textit{Micro City}. It does not benefit from activities because it manages them.}
        \ul{Recommendation}{A proposal to benefit from a specific activity in exchange for a reward.}
        \ul{Recommend}{The action of sending a recommendation to the guests.}
        \ul{Accept a Recommendation}{The action of accepting an activity recommendation and performing the action recommended in order to receive a reward.}
        \ul{Reward}{The recompense received by the guests that accept a recommendation. It may be given by activities or the \textit{Micro City} itself in order to promote specific behaviours.}
        \ul{Map}{The representation of the \textit{Micro City} containing useful information for the guests, as it reports the activities' positions. It supplies indications to the guests about routes to follow.}
        \ul{Route}{The path that links different activities.}
