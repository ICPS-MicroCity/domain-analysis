        \hline
        \textbf{Term} & \textbf{Definition}\\
        \hline
        \ul{Micro City}{Area with bounded temporal and spatial extension. It is attended by guests interested in the activities inside it.}
        \ul{Boundary}{Physical perimeter that defines the boundary of a \textit{Micro City}.}
        \ul{Lifetime of a Micro City}{The time span in which the Micro City is accessible by/open to guests.}
        \ul{Guest}{A person interested in activities offered by a \textit{Micro City}}
        \ul{Group of Guests}{A set of guests interested in the same activities.}
        \ul{Activity}{Service or event that is carried out inside a \textit{Micro City} that may satisfy a certain amount of guests with a certain frequency, depending on its duration. An activity has a default time period that establishes start and finish of its operativity. Moreover, it may be static or dynamic. A static activity cannot move, while a dynamic one may move if necessary.}
        \ul{Service}{Type of activity offered to guests. A service is continuously available during the \textit{Micro City}'s lifetime and allows guests to benefit from it at any time.}
        \ul{Event}{Type of activity offered to guests. An event takes place in a specific moment and is carried out only once; when it terminates, it won't be available anymore.}
        \ul{Satisfy}{The act of providing guests with an experience or a product, performed by an activity.}
        \ul{Benefit From/Attend}{The act of using an activity and being satisfacted by it, performed by a guest.}
        \ul{Time Period}{An activity's operativity time span. It is defined by a start and a finish.}
        \ul{Duration}{The time span used by an activity to satisfy the necessities of one or more guests.}
        \ul{Waiting Time}{Amount of time that guests wait before benefitting from an activity.}
        \ul{Queue}{Set of aligned guests due to long waiting times.}
        \ul{Fee}{Amount of money that guests may have to pay in order to access the \textit{Micro City} and/or to benefit from activities.}
        \ul{Wearable}{Device owned by each guest (or group of guests) that allows to interact with the \textit{Micro City}.}
        \ul{Worker}{Internal operator of a \textit{Micro City}. It does not benefit from activities because it manages them.}
        \ul{Recommendation}{A proposal to benefit from a specific activity in exchange of a reward.}
        \ul{Recommend}{The action of send a recommendation to guests.}
        \ul{Accept a Recommendation}{The act of following an activity recommendation in order to receive a reward.}
        \ul{Reward}{An advantage received by guests that follow a recommendation. It may be given by activities in order to promote specific behaviours.}
        \ul{Map}{Representation of a \textit{Micro City} containing useful information for guests, as it reports the activities' positions. It supplies indications abount routes that link activities.}
        \ul{Route}{The path that links different activities.}
