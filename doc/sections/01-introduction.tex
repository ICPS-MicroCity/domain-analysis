This document has the purpose of defining \textit{Micro City}'s concepts, in ordr to obtain a common starting point that would allow working groups to stay aligned during future works. Specifically, the context of the \textit{Micro City} will be analyzed defining an ubiquitous language of the domain. This language will be useful to give formal definitions to the domain's elements. Moreover, it will explain logic and semantic relationships among elements of the domain.

The \textit{MicroCity} concept was born observing contexts with common charactersitics, in which people could benefit from \textbf{self-awareness} and \textbf{situatedness} mechanisms in order to have better experiences.
