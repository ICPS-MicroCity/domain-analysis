This paper aims to define what the main concepts of \textit{Micro Cities} are in order to agree on a common domain knowledge that will allow working groups to stay consistent and coherent during future works.
To do so a ubiquitous language will be produced so that the core domain concepts will be properly analyzed and formalized.
Moreover, their logics, interactions and relationships will be illustrated and explained through diagrams.
